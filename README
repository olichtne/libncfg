# LibNCFG - Network Configuration Library

## Compilation
Create a new directory where you will build the library:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
Run cmake and make:
```
$ cmake /path/to/libncfg/source/dir/
$ make
```

## Running the example application
The example application is automatically compiled with the rest of the library,
the binary is called `main` and should be in the build/ directory.

Running ```./main help``` will list all available commands

## Examples

Before testing the application it is a good idea to create a few \emph{dummy}
devices, unfortunately this is not yet supported by the library so you need to
run the following commands, with root privileges:
```
$ ip link add dev dummy0 type dummy
$ ip link add dev dummy0 type dummy
```

To test the application you can try the following commands. It is assumed that
you have root privileges. To list information about detected devices:
```
./main list
```

To change the state of a device (you need root privileges for this):
```
./main set dev dummy0 down
```

To create a new bonding device and enslave the dummy devices:
```
modprobe bonding
./main add-device type bond name bond1
./main set dev dummy0 master bond1
./main add-slave dev bond1 dummy1
./main list
```

And to remove the created bonded device:
```
./main del-device bond1
```

You can also add IP addresses to the dummy devices:
```
./main add-addr dev dummy0 192.168.1.1/23
./main add-addr dev dummy0 fe80::2/64
./main list
```

Or change their MAC address:
```
./main set dev dummy0 hwaddr 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
